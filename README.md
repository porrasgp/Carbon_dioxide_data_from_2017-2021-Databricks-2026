# 🌍 Satellite-Based Atmospheric CO₂ Dataset

Source Data: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/satellite-carbon-dioxide?tab=overview

This dataset provides observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) amounts obtained from **satellite instruments** 🛰️. CO₂ is a naturally occurring **greenhouse gas (GHG)** 🌱, but human activities (e.g., fossil fuel combustion 🏭🔥, deforestation 🪓) have increased its abundance to **~420 ppm** (vs. pre-industrial 280 ppm). The annual cycle (🌳🍃 seasonal uptake/release by vegetation) is most pronounced in the northern hemisphere.

## 🔬 Measurement Methodology
- Satellites measure **near-infrared/infrared radiation** 🔆 reflected/emitted by Earth.
- **Absorption signatures** 📉 of CO₂ (and other gases) are analyzed in radiance data to determine column-averaged CO₂ abundance.
- **Retrieval algorithms** 💻⚙️ (software) process these signatures into CO₂ concentrations. Different algorithms have unique strengths/weaknesses ⚖️.
